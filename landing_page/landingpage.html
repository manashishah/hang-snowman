                    In a far-off land blanketed in snow, there once stood a joyful
                    snowman, his smile as radiant as the winter sun. But time
                    brought change, and with each game he lost, his joy faded.
                    Every wrong guess by players tore him apart, now, he is but a
                    shadow of his former self, a spectral figure torn by countless
                    failures, each wrong letter adding to his eternal winter.

                    It&apos;s your turn to face this haunted snowman. With each
                    letter, you hold his fate: to restore his lost soul or condemn
                    him further. His eyes, once full of life, now silently beg for
                    salvation or brace for continued sorrow. As the cold wind
                    whispers, consider your choices. Will you be his savior,
                    rekindling the warmth he once knew, or will you be the one to
                    leave him as a frozen monument, a relic of a soul that once
                    danced in the snow? The future of the Snowman rests in your
                    hands.
